        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year Business major at the University of California, Riverside, with a strong foundation in time management, teamwork, and leadership. As a commuter student, I have learned to balance a rigorous academic schedule with the demands of daily travel, which has helped me cultivate an ability to manage my time efficiently and prioritize tasks. This experience has honed my adaptability and reinforced my commitment to meeting deadlines and performing at my best.<br><br>

        Throughout my academic career, I have developed a variety of skills that have contributed to my personal and professional growth. I am dependable and take pride in my ability to meet expectations consistently. I hold myself accountable for my actions, readily admitting when Iâ€™ve made mistakes and taking proactive steps to rectify them. This integrity is something I value deeply, and it has become a cornerstone of my work ethic.During my time in high school, I gained valuable experience that has influenced my approach to teamwork and leadership. As a senior secretary, I was responsible for organizing school events, managing schedules, and ensuring effective communication between the student body and students outside of it.<br><br>

       This role not only sharpened my organizational skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving in a leadership capacity. I worked closely with my peers, contributing time and effort to make our school events successful and learning how to balance responsibilities while maintaining a collaborative attitude.I also contributed to my community by tutoring elementary school students and babysitting children, which provided me with the opportunity to develop patience, communication, and mentorship skills. These experiences helped me understand the importance of clear communication and the ability to work with people from different backgrounds and age groups. I learned how to break down complex ideas into easily understandable concepts and how to create a positive, supportive environment for others to thrive.I am now eager to apply these skills to real-world business settings, particularly in collaborative group environments. I am confident that my background in working with diverse groups will allow me to contribute meaningfully to any team. I am excited by the prospect of working alongside others, learning from their perspectives, and offering my own insights to help achieve collective goals. While I thrive in team settings, I am also capable of working independently and taking initiative when necessary.
